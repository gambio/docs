						Introduction
					-->
					<section id="introduction">
						<h1>Introduction</h1>
						<p>
							Before version v2.3.1.0 the shop's administration user interface was defined by multiple
							unstructured CSS files that was very hard to manage and use. That led to the creation of
							newer files every time a new page was about to be developed. This is not required any
							more because of the new gx-admin.css file, which is backwards compatible with the existing
							stylesheets but also provides new and easy to use styles that will help you build an admin
							page without the need of an extra stylesheet.
						</p>

						<p>
							Gx-admin.css was designed with semantic logic, inspired by major CSS frameworks like Bootstrap,
							Foundation etc. It implements more or less the same concept except from the fact that it is simpler and
							easier to use because it only contains the styling utils that a GX admin page would need. That said,
							every developer is always able to add his own custom CSS to a page when needed.
						</p>

						<p>
							The file was created with the use of SCSS and Compass and consists of multiple, well-structured
							sub-files that handle a different section of the admin section.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Boilerplate: Contains the most basic styling of the HTML elements.</li>
							<li>Extensions: Will style all the JavaScript extensions that are used.</li>
							<li>Theme: Defines all the theme-wide colors and mixins that are used by the other files.</li>
							<li>Fixes: Specific browser fixes that normalize the rendering of the admin section among
								different browsers.</li>
							<li>Widgets: Styles the widgets that are provided from the JS Engine of the shop.</li>
							<li>Compatibility: Implements the "gx-compatibility" mode for (old) pages.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="blockquote">But how can I use it?</div>
						<p>
							The gx-admin.css will be already included in every admin page that contains the "header.php" file
							the only thing required to get it working is to set the "gx-container" class to a parent element which
							will contain your HTML markup.
						</p>

						<div class="blockquote">What about compatibility?</div>
						<p>
							Since v2.5.1.0 the shop implements a compatibility mode that will automatically style old pages
							(with the help of JavaScript). You do not need to worry about compatibility when implementing new
							pages.
						</p>

						<p>
							Continue reading in order to learn how to use the gx-admin.css through the provided examples and
							demos. <strong>Keep in mind that you will need to place the "gx-container" class only once
							in your page and not for every container element as shown in the examples</strong>. The
							"gx-compatibility" class will be automatically added into old pages that use the "header.php" file.
						</p>

						<p>
							The gx-admin.css file is working closely with the JS Engine which is shipped with the
							project's source code. For more complex UI widgets take a look at the "JavaScript Engine"
							documentation.
						</p>

					<!--
						Typography
					-->
					<section id="typography">
						<h1>Typography</h1>
						<p>
							The stylesheet defines simple typography rules that will make your content fit smoothly with the
							rest of the UI elements. Heading sizes, line heights and margins as well as color are already defined.
						</p>
						<div class="example">
							<pre data-src="assets/examples-boilerplate/typography.html"></pre>
							<div data-preview="assets/examples-boilerplate/typography.html"></div>
						</div>
					</section>

					<!--
						Grid
					-->
					<section id="grid">
						<h1>Grid System</h1>
						<p>
							With the grid system you can easily define width for your forms and other content without
							setting hard coded with values. The full page is divided into 12 sections and you can get
							grab some space by choosing one of the span# classes as shown in the following example.
						</p>
						<div class="example split">
							<pre data-src="assets/examples-boilerplate/grid.html"></pre>
							<div data-preview="assets/examples-boilerplate/grid.html"></div>
						</div>
					</section>

					<!--
						Tables
					-->
					<section id="tables">
						<h1>Tables</h1>
						<p>
							Styling for table elements is predefined and you do not need to do anything. Once you create
							a table element with the complete structure (thead & tbody) your table will be styled like the
							rest of the administration section. Apply the "highlight" class to the highlighted row element.
						</p>
						<div class="example">
							<pre data-src="assets/examples-boilerplate/tables.html"></pre>
							<div data-preview="assets/examples-boilerplate/tables.html"></div>
						</div>
					</section>

					<!--
						Forms
					-->
					<section id="forms">
						<h1>Forms</h1>
						<p>
							You can easily structure and align form elements so that they look pretty and consistent
							within your various pages. All you have to do is to define small divs with label - input
							element pairs that have the "control-group" class. Optionally you can add the "block" class
							in order to get vertical alignment between the controls.
						</p>
						<div class="example split">
							<pre data-src="assets/examples-boilerplate/forms.html"></pre>
							<div data-preview="assets/examples-boilerplate/forms.html"></div>
						</div>

						<p>
							The form sumbit elements can be structured as in the following example.
						</p>

						<div class="example split">
							<pre data-src="assets/examples-boilerplate/forms-buttons.html"></pre>
							<div data-preview="assets/examples-boilerplate/forms-buttons.html"></div>
						</div>
					</section>

					<!--
						Helpers
					-->
					<section id="helpers">
						<h1>Helpers</h1>
						<p>
							The stylesheet includes some useful helpers that will help you define some custom properties
							like margin or padding, colors or custom components. Take a look at the following examples.
						</p>
						<div class="example split">
							<pre data-src="assets/examples-boilerplate/helpers.html"></pre>
							<div data-preview="assets/examples-boilerplate/helpers.html"></div>
						</div>
