        summary: 'Get Customer (Single)'
        description: 'Get a single customer record through the GET method. This resource supports the following GET parameters as described in the first section of documentation: sorting minimization, search, pagination and links. Additionally you can filter customers by providing the GET parameter "type=guest" or "type=registree". Sort and pagination GET parameters do not apply when a single customer record is selected (e.g. api.php/v2/customers/84). An example script to demonstrate how to fetch customer data is located under `./docs/REST/samples/customer-service/get_admin_data.php` in the git clone **Important**: Currently the CustomerReadService does not support searching in address information of a customer.'
