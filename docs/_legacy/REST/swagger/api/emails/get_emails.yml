        summary: 'Get Emails'
        description: 'Get multiple email records through the GET method. This resource supports the following GET parameters as described in the first section of documentation: sorting minimization, search, pagination. Additionally you can filter emails by providing the GET parameter "state=pending" or "state=sent". These filter parameters do not apply when a single emails record is selected (e.g. api.php/v2/emails/84) or when the emails are searched by the "q" parameter. To see an example usage take a look at `docs/REST/samples/email-service/fetch_email.php`'
