# Introduction Theme Development

In this part of the developers documentation we want to show you how to created a new theme. For this, the following
tutorials are part of a workshop about how to create a new theme called **Darkness**, which inherits from Malibu.

Darkness will be a dark version of Malibu with its own content manager entries, HTML templates and styles and some
additional features such as the dark mode switcher. By going through the necessary steps to create your theme, you
will get to know the theme system in a practical way.
