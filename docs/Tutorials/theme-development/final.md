# The final theme

Now we have created our own theme `Darkness` based on `Malibu`.

We learned how the architecture of a theme is built and how the shop works with themes. In addition, we learned how
to create our own theme based on another theme. Beyond that, we added our own content manager entries and assets to
the theme.

We also learned how to create overloading assets as well as our own assets, such as HTML templates, style
sheets and JavaScripts.

Finally, we learned how to add our own text phrases to the theme.

Granted, the new theme is not quite crisp yet. But the goal of the workshop is to understand and use the theme system.
Making it pretty is up to you!
