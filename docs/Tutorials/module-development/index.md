# Module Development

This part of our documentation explains bit by bit how to start the development of your module. Beside some
[development guidelines], we want to split the tutorials into categories. The general tutorials give you information
about the module system itself, how to extend it and tutorials that aren't just for the store or admin area.
Tutorials that are especially for the store or admin area can be found in the store or admin category.

If you start from scratch, it helps if you start reading the tutorial about [GXModules], which explains where to
place your module files. If you're creating a module for the admin area or using the event or command system, it's
recommended you also read the tutorial on [defining a module].

After setting up your development environment and start creating your basic module structure, the tutorials about
[extending HTML] and [CSS and JavaScript] might also be interesting. It's also possible to [add or change text phrases]
as well as to add a new language.

The tutorials about the public store area of the shop system focus more on [adding and managing HTTP routes],
[creating HTTP controllers], [creating a new theme], [adding content from the Content Manager] into your template
files or [adding new menu boxes]. The tutorials about the admin area show you how to [create HTTP actions], [extend
the admin menu], create a [generic module center module] using the `GXModule.json` or a [custom module center module],
as well as a [custom configuration page].
