# Development Environment

In order to set up the project or development environment, we assume that you already have some standard development
tools such as a **webserver**, **Git**, **Composer**, **Node** and **Yarn** installed. If this is not the case, you
can look up how to install them in the section about [required development tools].

It would also make sense to have access to our [Gitlab Server], as you can *fork* the shop project and *clone* it
from there. If you don't have access, you can request it or start with the files from a downloaded full version.

The section about [setting up the shop project] will show you how to set up the development environment based on
Gitlab access. More information about the support PHP versions or other requirements can be found
[here](https://tracker.gambio-server.net/projects/gxdoc/wiki/Unterst%C3%BCtzte_PHP-Versionen).
